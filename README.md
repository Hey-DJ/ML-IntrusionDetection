# Detection of Cyber-attacks on Network Infrastructure using Machine Learning Models
*Author:* Delan Jayasuriya<br>
*Published:* 4th February 2024

This is a capstone project for CodingNomads’ “Data Science and Machine Learning” course.

Its objective is to design and train a supervised ML (machine learning) model that can be used within an IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) to carry out anomaly-based detection to several classes of network attack vectors inlcuding:
-Brute-force attacks
-Heartbleed attacks
-Botnet
-Denial-of-Service (DoS)
-Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
-Web Attacks (eg cross-site scripting)
-Infiltration:
